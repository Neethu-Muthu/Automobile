## 🚀 **Introduction**

The **Automobile Use Case** is built on **Hyperledger Fabric**, a robust and permissioned blockchain framework designed for enterprise-level applications. This project allows stakeholders—**manufacturers**, **dealerships**, and **service centers**—to maintain a transparent and immutable ledger of all automobile-related transactions. The solution encompasses key use cases such as:
- 🚗 **Vehicle Registration** and **Ownership Transfer**
- 🔧 **Service History Tracking**
- 🛠️ **Vehicle Maintenance** and **Parts Management**

By ensuring that all actions related to a vehicle are securely recorded, this solution offers a seamless and trustworthy experience for all participants.

## 🌟 **Key Features**

- **📜 Vehicle Ownership Management**: Efficiently track vehicle ownership and transfer details on the blockchain, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.
- **🔧 Service Records**: Maintain an unalterable record of all services performed on the vehicle, providing transparency throughout its lifecycle.
- **🛠️ Maintenance Tracking**: Automatically log and track vehicle maintenance, ensuring that service history is always up to date.
- **🔐 Secure Transactions**: Blockchain’s decentralized, tamper-proof ledger ensures that every transaction is secure and verifiable.
- **🛠️ Role-Based Access**: Manage different roles like **Admin**, **Dealer**, and **Service Center** to ensure controlled interactions with the blockchain data.

---

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**

- **Hyperledger Fabric**: A leading blockchain framework for building permissioned, enterprise-grade applications.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the Hyperledger Fabric network, ensuring easy setup and deployment.
- **Node.js**: Provides the backend services for interacting with the blockchain, using REST APIs.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Used to develop smart contracts (chaincode) that govern the system's logic.
- **Visual Studio Code**: The IDE used for seamless development, debugging, and deployment.

---

## 🔍 **How It Works**

1. **Participants & Roles**: This solution involves various participants, each with their own role and permissions:
   - **Manufacturers**: Create and register new vehicles.
   - **Dealers**: Handle the sale and ownership transfer of vehicles.
   - **Service Centers**: Record service and maintenance activities.
   
2. **Smart Contracts (Chaincode)**: Blockchain logic is defined in **smart contracts** (chaincode), which control vehicle transactions, ownership transfers, and service history tracking.

3. **Blockchain Network**: Powered by **Hyperledger Fabric**, the decentralized ledger ensures all vehicle data is transparent, secure, and immutable.

4. **APIs**: Backend APIs are used to facilitate interaction with the blockchain, allowing participants to query vehicle history, update service records, and more.

   **Example Flow**:
   - A **Manufacturer** registers a new vehicle.
   - A **Dealer** transfers ownership of the vehicle to a customer.
   - **Service Centers** log and update vehicle maintenance history.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

The architecture of the system is designed for scalability and transparency:

1. **Hyperledger Fabric Network**: A distributed network consisting of **peer nodes**, **orderers**, and **channels** to manage and validate transactions.
2. **Chaincode (Smart Contracts)**: Defines business rules for vehicle registration, ownership transfer, and service tracking.
3. **Client Application**: A user interface that allows various participants (admins, dealers, service centers) to interact with the blockchain through RESTful APIs.
4. **Database**: Stores off-chain data such as **user details**, **vehicle images**, and **service records**.
