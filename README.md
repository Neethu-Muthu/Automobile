## **Introduction**

The **Automobile Use Case** is built on **Hyperledger Fabric**, a permissioned blockchain framework designed for enterprises. This project enables various participants, including manufacturers, dealerships, and service centers, to maintain a transparent ledger of automobile transactions. The solution covers several use cases, including:
- Vehicle Registration and Ownership Transfer
- Service History Tracking
- Vehicle Maintenance and Parts Management

The goal is to provide a secure and immutable record of all actions related to a vehicle throughout its lifecycle.

## **Features**

- **Vehicle Ownership Management**: Track vehicle ownership and transfer details securely and immutably.
- **Service Records**: Record all services performed on the vehicle, ensuring a clear and transparent maintenance history.
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Automate and monitor vehicle maintenance activities, keeping an up-to-date service log.
- **Secure Transactions**: Use blockchain's secure and immutable ledger to prevent fraud and ensure trust among participants.
- **Role-based Access**: Different roles such as Admin, Dealer, and Service Center with varying permissions to interact with the blockchain.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Hyperledger Fabric**: A permissioned blockchain framework for building enterprise-grade applications.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the Hyperledger Fabric network components.
- **Node.js**: For backend API services that interact with the blockchain network.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: For smart contract development and interaction with the blockchain.
- **VS Code**: IDE used for development and deployment.

## **How It Works**

1. **Participants and Roles**: The solution allows participants such as Manufacturers, Dealerships, Service Centers, and Vehicle Owners to interact with the system.
2. **Smart Contracts (Chaincode)**: We implement smart contracts that define the rules for vehicle transactions, service records, and ownership transfers.
3. **Blockchain Network**: The system runs on Hyperledger Fabric, ensuring decentralization, security, and transparency of all transactions.
4. **APIs**: Backend APIs are developed to interact with the blockchain and provide functionalities like querying the vehicle history, updating service records, etc.
   
   Here's a simplified flow:
   - A **Manufacturer** creates a new vehicle record on the blockchain.
   - A **Dealer** handles vehicle sales and transfers ownership.
   - **Service Centers** add maintenance records and updates service logs.

## **Architecture**

The architecture consists of:
1. **Hyperledger Fabric Network**: Composed of peer nodes, orderers, and channels.
2. **Chaincode**: Smart contracts managing the logic for vehicle registration, ownership transfer, and service tracking.
3. **Client Application**: Provides an interface for various participants to interact with the blockchain through RESTful APIs.
4. **Database**: Use a database to store off-chain data, such as user information,
